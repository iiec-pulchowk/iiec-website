(1, 1, 'Trail Evaluation', 
 'The trail evaluation took place from March 11th to 13th, 2021, with varying weather conditions throughout the three-day period. The trail encompasses diverse terrain, commencing with a pleasant climb out of Dhorpatan valley, followed by a descent towards Nisel Dhor along the Uttar ganga river. The route meanders along the sides of three hills, offering a gradual descent interspersed with occasional steep ascents, culminating in a long, taxing final ascent before Nisel Dhor. The journey begins at the Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve entry check post, with almost half of the route traversing a flat, picturesque valley.',
